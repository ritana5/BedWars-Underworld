#    Here you can list the arena groups that will be used for the Rush gamemode.    #
#   Make sure that the groups you list here actually exist and were created using   #
#       the (BedWars1058 and BedWars2023) /bw arenaGroup create <group-name>.       #
#  You can check with /bw arenaGroup list, and to make sure the arenas you want in  #
# these groups are in the groups, use /bw arenaGroup set <arena-name> <group-name>. #
arena-groups:
  - "underworld_solo"
#  Here you can change the emerald amount, delay, and spawnlimit of the forge upgrade due to  #
# a lack of the ability to set them to spawn automatically in the code of the BedWars plugins #
